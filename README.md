# Digital Root Calculator

Using python, I have put together a calculator to calculate digital roots.
To get the digital root, you would take a multi-digit number like "12345" and have each digit add up one to
another until you get a single digit number. If it adds up to a multi-digit number, then it'll keep the process
going until it results as a single digit number.

Ex: What is the digital root of "12345"? 

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 

1 + 5 = 6

Digital root of 12345 is 6.

If you need to quit the command prompt, type in "q" or "quit" to close prompt.
